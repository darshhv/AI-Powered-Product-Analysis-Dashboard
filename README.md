Introduction
This product analysis tool leverages cutting-edge AI technologies to offer a comprehensive solution for bottle image classification and analysis. With integrated functionalities for classification, comparison, interactive querying via a chatbot, and report generation, this system provides an intuitive and automated method for evaluating bottle designs based on key features like:

Thermal Insulation Efficiency

Leak-Proof Design

Durability & Impact Resistance

Chemical Leaching & Safety

Ergonomics & Handling Comfort

These functional factors, along with other visual and morphological data, help provide actionable insights into the bottle's performance, suitability, and market potential.

Key Features
1. Advanced Bottle Classification
Classify bottles across a wide range of categories, including:

Master Categories: Beverage, Cosmetic, Household, Specialty, etc.

Subtypes: Plastic, Glass, Aluminum, etc.

Morphological Features: Tall, Slim, Bulbous, etc.

Functional Factors: Insulation, Durability, Leak-Proof Design, etc.

Real-World Usage: Eco-friendly, Reusable, Single-use, etc.

Each prediction includes confidence scoring and can be visualized with easy-to-read bar charts.

2. AI-Powered Product Comparison
Compare two bottles side by side for all predicted attributes, providing a clear, comparative analysis. Ideal for evaluating the differences and making informed design decisions.

3. Interactive AI Assistant
The integrated AI Assistant, powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5, provides in-depth analysis, recommendations, and expert insights based on the uploaded bottle image. Ask specific questions about the bottle, and get natural language responses from the AI.

4. Confidence Scores and Visualizations
The application provides not only predictions but also confidence levels for each attribute, helping users assess the reliability of the model's analysis. These scores are visualized through interactive charts, enhancing interpretability.

5. Downloadable Reports
Generate PDF reports based on the predictions and analysis, which include all of the classification details, confidence levels, and functional assessments. These reports can be shared with stakeholders or used for documentation purposes.

6. Scalable and Real-Time Predictions
The tool is designed for real-time predictions, enabling businesses to analyze product images quickly and efficiently. Whether you're handling a single bottle or a large batch, the system scales to meet the demand.

Getting Started
To run this project locally or deploy it in your environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine or cloud environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/darshhv/AI-Powered-Product-Analysis-Dashboard.git
cd AI-Powered-Product-Analysis-Dashboard
2. Install Dependencies
Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed and the necessary libraries via pip. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all the necessary libraries for model training, image processing, data manipulation, and the web application.

3. Set Up OpenAI API Key
To integrate the AI-powered assistant, you’ll need an OpenAI API key. Obtain the API key by signing up at OpenAI and set it in your environment variables or directly in the code as follows:

python
Copy
Edit
openai.api_key = "your-openai-api-key"
4. Download Pre-trained Models
To download the necessary pre-trained models, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python download_models.py
This will download the model weights from a pre-configured Google Drive link using the gdown package.

5. Run the Application
Launch the web dashboard by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
This will start the application locally. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501 to access the dashboard.

User Guide
1. Uploading a Bottle Image
Once the dashboard is running, go to the Upload & Predict section, where you can upload an image of the bottle you wish to analyze. The image will be processed and classified into various attributes.

2. Real-Time Prediction and Confidence Scores
After uploading the image, the dashboard will display the classification results for each category (e.g., Master Category, Subtype, Functional Factors) along with confidence scores represented as percentages.

3. Comparison of Bottles
To compare two bottles, navigate to the Compare Bottles section. Upload two images, and the system will provide side-by-side analysis, helping you evaluate the differences.

4. Querying the AI Assistant
In the Chat with AI section, you can interact with the AI-powered assistant. Ask questions related to the bottle's features or design, and the system will generate expert-level responses in real-time.

5. PDF Report Generation
After predictions are made, you can download the results as a PDF by clicking the Generate Report button. This will provide a detailed, formatted analysis for the uploaded bottle.

Model Training
The underlying deep learning model for image classification is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are trained on a comprehensive dataset of bottle images. The model is fine-tuned for each category and factor to ensure accurate predictions. You can re-train or modify the models if needed by following the instructions in the Model Training section of this repository.

Architecture
The application follows a modular architecture, consisting of the following components:
